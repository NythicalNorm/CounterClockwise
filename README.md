## Credits

The code for the storage interface, sticker, and mechanical arm comes from
VS addition, which is licensed under MIT. Some changes have been made, but credit
for the main logic goes to xwzy.

Packages/files that use VS addition code:
- `[java].mixin.create.mechanical_arm.*`
- `[java].mixin.create.psi.*`
- `[java].mixin.create.sticker.*`
- `[java].mixinducks.create.mechanical_arm.*`
- `[java].mixinducks.create.portable_interface.*`
- `[kotlin].create.psi.*`
- `[kotlin].create.sticker.*`
- `[kotlin].ships.JointGroup`
